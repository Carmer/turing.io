  %h2 Turing Turns Great Aptitude Into Great Developers.
  %p Being a developer takes the right mix of passion, curiosity, creativity, and confidence. We’ve found that combination across a variety of background including financial analysts, warehouse managers, bartenders, musicians and electrical engineers. If you’re ready to solve difficult problems then we can turn you into a professional software developer.

.mod-about
  %h2 Become a Professional Developer
  %p This is not a bootcamp. We're not teaching you to pass an interview. This is a seven month, full-time program for people who want to become professional developers.
  %p In 2012 the Jumpstart Lab team created HungryAcademy at LivingSocial. In 2013 we co-created the gSchool Ruby program in Denver. Now we're excited to bring you the<br/>Turing School of Software & Design.
  %p <a href="http://apply.turing.io">Applications are open now</a> and admissions are rolling. Based on past classes, we anticipate a selection rate under 10%. Invited students can select from our 2014 cohorts starting June 2nd, July 21st, September 8th, or October 27 all in Denver, CO.
  %p Full tuition details will be published in the next few days, but in brief the tuition is $17,500 if paid up front. Students wanting to minimize up-front cost can pay $5,000 by the first day of class, then $472/month for 36 months after the program.
