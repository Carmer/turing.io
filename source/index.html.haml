      %p
        There are many organizations who try to teach programming. Few of them have our experience
        and track record. You'll build over a dozen complex, high-quality, full-stack applications. You'll learn from a staff that mixes educators-turned-programmers and programmers-turned-educators to
        deliver the highest quality instruction anywhere.

      “I chose this program because it was the only one that promised to produce professional developers and not just give you a kickstart. I had no computer science background and needed to have a real job at the end of it. <br/><br/>We learned by doing – by working together to build real applications, completely immersed in programming. Now I use those skills every day.“
